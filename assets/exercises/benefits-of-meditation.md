# Benefits of Meditation
Meditation is a powerful practice that can improve your life.
It's been a part of human spirituality for thousands of years.
Meditation can improve your focus, reduce your stress, and bring you joy.
Most meditation practices start by focusing on your breath.

Breathe in through your nose / hold it for a few seconds / and breath out through your mouth
In... / hold... / and out
By focusing on your breath, you help train your brain to focus deeply.
This focus helps in all sorts of situations.
Focus makes it easier to study and learn.
It also helps you be more productive at work.
And focus can feel fun, especially when you're in a state of "flow".
You probably won't find flow in breathing exercises.
But these exercises help you build up the cognitive muscles to focus more easily.
This exercise probably has you breathing slower than normal. This too is a benefit of meditation.
By breathing slower, you calm your autonomic processes. Your whole body relaxes.
A practice of deep and slow breathing reduces stress and anxiety, and increases your mental health.
Meditation can help ease the symptoms of depression as much as anti-depressants.
With practice, you can even slow down how quickly you react to stressful situations.
Slowing your reactions can help prevent kneejerk responses that you may regret later. 
Because of this, some people find their relationships with friends and family deepened through meditation.
In addition to helping in your studies, job, or relationships, meditation can also bring you joy.
Experienced meditators can achieve euphoric experiences akin to psychadelics.
But even without a lot of practice, meditation can help you find everyday joy.
Often, this is achieved by pairing meditation with "mindfulness".
Mindfulness helps you notice the everyday marvels that surround us.
It grounds us, and connects us to our community, human and otherwise. 
Meditation can help you find more mindful moments in your day.

Meditation can be a powerful way to improve your life. 
And even better, anyone can meditate.
You can start seeing some benefits from only a few minutes of meditation each day.
Even a single meditative breath can help you de-stress. 
It can be difficult at first to get started
but it is worth the effort. 
We're glad to see you on this path with us!
