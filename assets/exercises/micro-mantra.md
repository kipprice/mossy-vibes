# Micro Mantra Test
This exercise helps you try out a new mantra to see if it helps you
First, try repeating your mantra on your in-breath, hold, and out-breath

/

Now, over the course of one full breath, slowly repeat your mantra

/

Next, try to set the mantra to mental music by tapping your foot as you repeat it

/

Last, speak your mantra out loud

/

If the mantra still resonates with you, try using it the next time you meditate
If it seems a little silly now, or if you found yourself getting bored with it, feel free to try out a new mantra with this exercise
