# Mindfulness
Today, we'll talking about mindfulness.
Mindfulness describes the state of being truly present in the moment.
Even if you never meditate, you may find yourself being mindful.
Many people fall into mindfulness when spending time in nature.
Mindfulness is grounding. It connects your physical being to your mental being.
Most people find mindfulness calming and harmonious.
Meditation helps make it easier to find moments of mindfulness.
And in particular, meditation can help you be mindful even when you are feeling a lot of stress.
This exercise is designed to help you find your mindfulness.

Start by bringing your attention to your breath.
Breathing in... / holding it... / and breathing out.
In... / hold... / and out.
Most meditations start by focusing on your breath.
That's because we usually don't spend much time thinking about breathing. 
By focusing on our breath, we train our ability to stay in the "now".
Try to keep your breathing steady as you go through the exercise.

Now, we'll start finding our mindfulness.
Our senses are powerful ways to connect to our present. Let's start with smell. 
As you breathe in, notice any scents around you. 
Let yourself react to those scents and any memories or feelings you have towards them.
Try to keep your thoughts focused on what you are smelling.

Next, let's bring attention to your eyes or ears.
Take in everything that is happening around you.
What sights and sounds surround you, especially those you aren't usually aware of.
Try to find details you've never noticed before. We are surrounded by small marvels.
Keep your attention on what you are perceiving and how you react to it.

Last, we'll focus on our internal senses.
Start gently tilting your head in different directions.
With each tilt, notice how your balance shifts.
If you are able to sit or stand, try shifting your weight in different directions.
Notice how your body moves to accomodate that shift, and where gravity pulls you.
Try to visualize your internal center of gravity shifting as your body does.

Congratulations! You've found a moment of mindfulness!
Like anything else, mindfulness comes easier with practice.
Try to set aside a few minutes each day to go through a meditation exercise.
Even just a single mindful breath can help improve your ability to be present in the moment.
Enjoy your mindfulness!
