# Managing Reactions to Strong Emotions
Experiencing strong emotions can bring us to act in ways we don't want to
Anger can cause us to lash out | Grief can keep us isolated from our community
This exercise can help you control the way you react to strong emotions
To start, bring your attention to your breath

Breathe in... / hold... / and out
Now begin reflecting on an emotion you'd like to react to differently
Examine how the reaction you want to avoid helps lessen the emotion in the moment
Lashing out in anger can help relieve the tension anger brings 
Isolation can make it easier to hide overwhelming grief
Seek to understand why that reaction emerged and how it helps manage the triggering emotion
This understanding can guide the reaction you start building instead

The first step to reacting in the way you'd like is to make sure you're in control of when you react
To practice, think of a recent situation where you initially reacted in a way you'd prefer not to
It's easier if this is a small incident, where the emotion doesn't still feel overwhelming
Bring yourself back to the emotional state you were experiencing in the situation 
Try to replicate the feelings and physical state that emerged in the moment
Once you feel similarly to how you did within the situation...

Take one full breath
Notice how bringing attention to your breath helps put space between the triggering situation and the way you react
This space is what allows your conscious brain to kick in, and change your natural reaction
Practice extending the number of breaths you can take before reacting 
Each breath gives you more time to be in control of your reaction
This can be difficult when actually experiencing a strong emotion 
But the more you practice, the more natural this pause can become 

Once you're able to pause before reacting, you can start changing how you react altogether
This is where understanding your natural reaction comes in key 
For the change to work, the new reaction needs to solve a similar problem
For example, an exercise routine might offer a similar tension relief as lashing out when angry
Often, you can determine whether a reaction will work just through visualization

Imagine being in an emotionally-charged scenario, where you'd like to avoid your natural reaction
Then imagine reacting in the way you'd prefer instead
An effective reaction will be one that offers relief even within your mind 
And visualizing the way you want to react makes it easier to actually react that way

Strong emotions are signals | They help guide our decisions to ensure we get what we need
And with practice and pauses, you can control the way you react to those emotions
We hope you have an emotionally-balanced day
