# Mossy Vibes Overview
Hello from Kip & HJ, the creators of Mossy Vibes!
Whether you're brand new to meditating or have years of practice, Mossy Vibes is here to help fit meditation into your day
This exercise is designed to acquaint you with how Mossy Vibes works
First, as you can see, Mossy Vibes is reading-based
We chose this for two reasons:
First, to make a meditation app designed for folks who prefer or need written communication
And second, to make it easier to meditate even when you only have a few minutes to spare
You can change the speed at which words are highlighted through the Settings screen (which you can reach from the top-right corner)
Like most meditation exercises, Mossy Vibes centers meditation around your breathing

This is the animation you'll see anytime you should focus on your breath. 
The dotted circle expands on the in-breath, stays steady on the hold, and shrinks on the out-breath
Breathe in... / hold... / and out
You can also change your preferred breathing speed in the Settings screen

That's the extent of our overview! 
We try to add new exercises every day
Our goal is to keep Mossy Vibes free forever
If you'd like to help us with that, we have a donate link in the menu
We hope Mossy Vibes helps you find more opportunities for meditation!
