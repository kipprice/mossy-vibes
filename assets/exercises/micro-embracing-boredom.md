# Micro Embracing Boredom
This exercise can help you manage feelings of boredom

Start by breathing in... / hold... / ...and out
As you breathe in, let your mind wander | As you breathe out, refocus your attention on your breath
You can also bring your attention to your surroundings, focusing on one sense at a time
Listen to your thoughts... / / ...and refocus on your breath
Listen... / / ...and refocus

Return to this exercise any time you'd like to practice embracing boredom
