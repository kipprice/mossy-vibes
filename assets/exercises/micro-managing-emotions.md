# Micro Managing Reactions
This exercise can help you manage the way you react to strong emotions

Start by breathing in... / hold... / ...and out
When you feel ready, start examining what you're feeling
Try to understand why the emotion emerged, and what reaction it triggers in you
Then use your breath to delay that reaction until you feel in control
Understand the emotion... / / ...and delay your reaction
Understand... / / ...and delay

Return to this exercise any time you'd like to practice managing reactions.
