# Overwhelm
It can be very difficult when multiple stresses pile on top of one another
With each added obligation, it becomes harder to calmly work through problems
Today’s exercise can help you feel less overwhelmed
Let’s first focus on our breathing

Breathe in... / hold it... / and out
Try to only focus on your breath | Put aside your stress for now
Breathe in... / hold... / and out
We are going to focus on one stress at a time, and use our breath to let it go
Think about one solitary stress
This might be a stress from work, home, or a social situation
Breathe in to focus | And as you breathe out, release it to the universe
Focus / / and release
/
If that stress is still on your mind, that's okay
Try to bring your attention to a different stress
Focus on this new stress / / and now breathe it back into the universe
/
Let’s focus on one final stress
This might be something you didn’t realize was causing you stress until now
Breathe in to focus / / breathe out to let it go
/
You can continue to do this with each stress in your day | Take as many breaths as you need for each 
It won’t make the stresses go away, but it can help them feel less overwhelming
Remember, feeling overwhelmed by stress isn’t a personal fault | Everyone feels and reacts in different ways
And with meditation, you may start to look at each problem from a new perspective

We hope this has helped you feel a little less overwhelmed
