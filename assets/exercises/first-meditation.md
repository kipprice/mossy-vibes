# Welcome Exercise
Welcome to Mossy Vibes! 
We're here to help you build up your meditation practice 
Today, we'll be taking you through a very quick meditation
Let's start by bringing attention to your breathing

Take a breath in... / hold it... / and breathe out
One more... / hold... / and out

That's it for today! Congratulations on meditating
