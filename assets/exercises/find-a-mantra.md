# Finding a Mantra
There are a lot of different techniques and practices for meditation
One such tool is a mantra (which literally translated means "instrument of thought")
Mantras are words or phrases that help ground, uplift, or focus you
Just like breathing, they help you center your thoughts within a meditation
Finding a mantra is a very personal experience
This exercise will help you explore what mantras might work for you
Let's start by focusing on our breathing

Breathe in... / hold... / and breathe out
We're going to start by introducing some common or useful mantras
With each one, try repeating it on each in-breath, hold, and out-breath
We're starting with traditional Sanskrit mantras, which can be repeated in Sanskrit or as their English translations. 
"Om". The sound of creation and the universe; represents the unity of the mind, body, and soul
"So Hum" or "I am that". Recognizes your oneness with the universe.
"Shanti" or "Peace". Represents internal and external harmony. 
Next, let's try some affirmations. 
"I am enough". Recognizes your inherent worthiness.
"I am loved". Honors the connections you have with the world around you.
"I am strong". Recognizes internal and external strength.
"I am home". Grounds you in this moment.
A mantra can be any word or phrase that holds meaning for you. 
"Love". "Bravery". "Integrity". "It doesn't need to be perfect"
It can be a reminder of one of your core grounding memories.
"That perfect day". "The big storm". "When we met".
It can reference a way you find connection to the world.
"Together, we rise". "One day at a time". "Be kind".
It can even be a word that's just fun to say! (that joy can help you focus)
"Perpindicular". "Whippersnapper". "Sassafrass".
Use these last two breaths to explore any other mantras you may have thought of.

With that, bring your attention back to the present
It's okay if none of these quite fit
You may end up needing to try a lot of mantras before one really clicks
Everyone finds different mantras meaningful
And a mantra that works well for you in a particular moment may not help in every moment
Let yourself explore and experiment with different mantras
You can use the "Mantra Test" micro meditation to explore whether a particular mantra works for you
Have a mindful rest of your day!
