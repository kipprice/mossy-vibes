# Gratitude
Today we'll be doing an exercise focused on gratitude.
This exercise can help make it easier to focus on positive forces in your life.

Start by focusing on your breathing
In... / ...hold / ...and out
Follow your breath as it flows in / / and out
Once you're ready, gently shift your focus to your body.
Are there areas that used to cause you pain, but no longer do?
How much relief do you experience by not being in that pain?
Spend a moment celebrating not having that discomfort.
If you wish, you can thank your body for healing.
Next, shift your focus to a supportive force in your life. A family member, a friend, a pet.
Who or what in your life lifts you up?
How do you feel when you have that support?
What do you appreciate about this presence? 
Spend a moment reveling in the support you receive from this force.
If you wish, thank them for supporting you.
Now, bring your attention to an activity you love doing. 
How does it feel to be immersed in that activity?
How does your participation in it help fuel or inspire you?
Spend a moment honoring the joy you feel when doing this activity.
If you wish, thank this activity for bringing joy to your life.
Lastly, think back upon the last couple of days.
What was the brightest moment you experienced?
It's okay if it's not a moment of joy. 
Some days are hard all the way through. On those days, something neutral can be a win. 
If you wish, thank that situation for being a positive in your day. 

With that, our exercise draws to a close.
Meditating on gratitude can help rekindle the parts of your life that bring you joy. 
You may find new aspects to be grateful for each time you revisit this exercise.
We hope you've found some joy through this meditation.
