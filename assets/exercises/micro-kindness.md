# Micro Kindness
This exercise can help you build up your ability to extend kindness

Start by breathing in... / hold... / out
Think of someone you want to extend kindness to (including yourself)
As you breathe, take in kindness and connection from the world, and with your breath out, extend it to that person
Kindness in... / / ...and out to the person
Kindness in... / / ...and out

Return to this exercise any time you'd like to practice extending kindness
