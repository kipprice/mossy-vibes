# Morning Meditation
Meditation can be a peaceful and powerful way to start your day
This exercise helps you begin your day mindfully

Start by focusing on your breathing
Breathe in... / hold... / and out
In... / / and out
/
Feel your breath extend energy through your body
This energy empowers you
It gives you the opportunity to take on meaningful work
Now, notice how gravity pulls you downwards
This force grounds you
It connects you to the earth and all other beings on it
Explore what your body is feeling
Aches communicate your body's needs
Honoring those needs can keep your physical and mental wellbeing in balance
Now, bring to mind the people closest to you
Love and friendship enrich and uplift you
Your community supports you, even when you're feeling low
We'll close with a few more moments focused on our breathing
If there's a phrase that came to mind through the exercise, you can try repeating it as you breathe
In... / hold... / and out
In... / / ...and out
/
Last one... / / ...and out

That's all for today.
We hope you have a wonderful, mindful day!
