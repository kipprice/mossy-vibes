# Practice Your Breathing
One of the most important elements when it comes to meditation is breath control
By focusing on your breathing, you help train your mind to focus

Let's start by taking a deep breath in... / holding it... / and releasing slowly
In... / hold... / and out...
Breathe in through your nose / / and out with your mouth
Focus on your breathing
Try to follow the path your breath takes through your body
Just a few more / hold... / out...
In... / / ...and out
Last one

Great job! You've started building up your powers of focus
Just one mindful breath a day can make focusing easier.
Enjoy your focus today!
