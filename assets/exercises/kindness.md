# Kindness
Kindness helps us be the best version of ourselves
It helps both the giver and the recipient find connection and growth
Kindness is different than niceness, which emphasizes social comfort
Kindness can be uncomfortable | Growth often requires discomfort
But building up your capacity for kindness can help you stay true to your values and principles
This exercise can help you strengthen your practice of extending kindness
To start, bring your attention to your breath

Breathe in... / hold... / and out
As you breathe, think of someone who you wish to extend kindness to
If you're new to this, you may want to start by extending kindness to a loved one
It's easier to extend kindness to someone who you already feel warmly about
As you get more comfortable, you can try extending kindness to someone you don't feel as positively about
That may be someone who gets on your nerves | Or it can be yourself, if you tend to be self-critical
We'll be using our breath as a channel for our kindness
With your breath in, you take in kindness from the world around you...
And with your breath out, you send that kindness to your chosen recipient
Breathe kindness in... / / and extend that kindness
Wish for them to find the internal and external peace we all strive for
That they are able to live according to their values and principles
And that their connections strengthen and uplift the best version of themselves
Once more, kindness in... / / and extend that kindness

Bring your attention back to the present
Kindness is an invitation for everyone to find internal harmony 
It doesn't forgive or forget harm that someone has done | But it offers the opportunity to make amends
Sometimes, even though we don't intend to, we can find ourselves being unkind
To ourseives, to our loved ones, or to individuals we don't know very well
By practicing extending kindness, we also help ourselves find our inner harmony
We hope you have kindness-filled day
