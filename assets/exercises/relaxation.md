# Relaxation
Meditation can be a powerful way to relax
This exercise will teach you a classic way to use your attention to soothe your body

Start by focusing on your breathing
Take a breath in... / ...hold it / ...and out
In... / hold... / and out
Focus on the breath moving through your body
In... / / and out
Now, spend a moment taking stock of what your body is currently feeling
Where are you holding tension? Where are you experiencing pain?
Become aware of what your body is experiencing in this moment
/
When you're ready, shift your focus towards your feet
On your breath in, tense your toes / then as you start to breath out / release all of that tension
/
Once your toes are relaxed, move your attention to your feet
And as you did with your toes, tense on your breath in / and as you prepare to breathe out / release that tension.
/
We'll be repeating this cycle of tense-then-release through your whole body
Take your time, and focus on getting to a relaxed state. 
Especially focus on the parts of your body that hold more tension.
If you haven't already, shift your focus to your lower legs
Tense... / / ...and relax 
Now your knees and thighs
Tense... / / ...and relax
If you ever find one breath isn't enough to fully relax, feel free to spend more time getting to a truly relaxed state
Move your focus to your pelvis 
Tense... / / ...and relax
Keep shifting your focus up your body
Tense your stomach... / / and relax
/
Your chest... / / and relax
/
Your shoulders... / / and relax
/
Your neck... / / and relax
/
Finally reaching the top of your head, tense... / / and relax
/
Now bring your awareness to your body as a whole. With each out breath, try to relax even further.
In... / / and relax
In... / / and deeper into relaxation.
/
Once again, take stock of your body's current state.
Spend some more time with any areas that still feel tense
Let yourself sink into full relaxation
/

With that, we draw this exercise to a close
If you don't feel fully relaxed yet, feel free to continue focusing on your body
/
And when you're ready, enjoy your relaxation
