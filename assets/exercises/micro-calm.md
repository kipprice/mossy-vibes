# Micro Calm
It can be hard to expect yourself to just "keep calm"
Today we'll be using meditation to find calmness

Start by breathing in... / holding that breath... / and letting it out
By concentrating on our breathing, we can let ourselves be calm
There's no need to force calmness
Breathing helps our bodies' natural rhythm resume 

You can return to this exercise whenever you need a moment of calm
