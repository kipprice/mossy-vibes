# Creating Stability
There's a lot in the world that can make us doubt ourselves or others
The world around us is always changing | As is our position within it
As humans, we often try to force stability into our world
But in trying to control things, we can actually make it harder for ourselves
No one can control everything that puts stress on our lives
But meditation can make it easier to find where you can build stability
Or to find that stability within yourself
Let's start by focusing on our breathing

Breathe in... / hold... / and out
As you breathe, reflect on an aspect of your life you find yourself trying to control
This could be a chaotic situation, a tough relationship, or an unfulfilled goal
We're going to be exploring ways you can find mental stability in these situations
/
Sometimes, we feel destabilized because we hold in our mind what "could" or "should" be, insted of what "is"
Our assumptions and presumptions are always in our control
If the mismatch between "could" and "is" is a source of instability, give yourself permission to let go of "could"
With your breath, release these expectations
/
Sometimes, we feel destabilized because of the amount of pressure we place on ourselves
If you find yourself weighed down by your own expectations, try gently reminding yourself of your humanity
You do not need to fix everything | You do not need to be perfect | You are one part of many
As you breathe, try repeating a word or phrase that reminds you it is okay to have limits and boundaries
/
Destabilization can also come from your core values being challenged
This can feel like you're pretending to be someone you're not
Our values make us who we are | They are always there to draw from
Often, you can reframe something that feels out of character to align with a different value
As you breathe, try to identify how your values do line up with the situation | Embrace where they do align
/

Let your attention return to the present
Relinquishing control doesn't mean you give up on ever finding stability
Nor does it mean you give up on ever changing a bad situation
Instead, it helps you channel your focus towards the things you can control
Your mind, your reactions, and your self-perception
We hope this exercise has helped you find some stability!
