# Love
Love is a powerful emotion that grounds and connects us
It's so powerful that we often hesitate to use the word "love"
But today we are going to embrace it
Let's start by bringing attention to our breath

Take a breath in... / hold it... / and breathe out
In... /  hold... / and out
As you breathe, think of someone you love
Someone who makes you feel like your best and truest self
This could be a friend, a partner, a family member, or even a pet
Can you see their face in your mind?
Or feel the love you have for them deep in your heart?
Does that feeling of love make you smile?
Perhaps you find yourself filled with gratitude that they are in your life
Take a moment to fully feel that love today
/
Loving someone can be an incredibly fulfilling human experience
Just as being loved connects and supports us 
Think of everyone you love and who love you 
That's your community
As you breathe in, absorb the love your community extends to you
And let your out-breath extend your love back to your community
Breathe in love.../  /breathe out love
You are loved.../  /and you are loving
/

That's all for this excercise 
Try to hold this love within you throughout your day
We are sending our loving breath to you!
