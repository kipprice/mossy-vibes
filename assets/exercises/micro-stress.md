# Micro Meditation: Stress
This exercise helps you find a moment to relieve some stress

Start by breathing in... / hold... / and out
As you breathe out, imagine releasing a bit of your stress
You can also try repeating a calming phrase, like "it's okay", as you breathe out
With your breath, carry this stress out of your body and mind.

Any time you are feeling very stressed, try returning to this practice
