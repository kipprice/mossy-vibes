# Micro Meditation: Presence
This exercise helps bring your focus back to the "now"

Start by breathing in... / hold... / and out
As you breathe, soak in everything your senses are detecting
Let yourself be fully immersed in this moment
You are here... / you are present... / you belong in this moment

Use this practice to stay present throughout your day
