# Taking a Moment
A practice of meditation can help you have more control over how you react to stressful situations
Generally, when you experience a trigger, you react to it very quickly
Your subconscious leaps in to address whatever is happening
But that means that you don't always react the way you'd hope to
Meditation can help change your reactions from subconscious to conscious
That process starts by taking a moment between experiencing a trigger and reacting to it

Start by focusing on your breathing
Breathe in... / hold... / and out
In... /  / and out
/ 
Once you're ready, we're going to start strengthening our ability to take a moment
Start by thinking of something that annoys you a little
It's important that this be a minor annoyance, something that wouldn't ruin your day
Something like being delayed on your way home, or getting your socks wet
It's easier to take a moment with the small things to start
Imagine yourself in that situation, and how you would normally react
This works best if you're really able to feel that minor annoyance 
Let yourself physically express your signs of stress; jaw tension, frowns, deep sighs, whatever comes naturally to you
Now, let's try to insert a moment between that trigger and your reaction
First, take a breath to reset
Next, put yourself back into that mildly annoying situation. Visualize the trigger in detail
And take one breath before reacting
After that single breath, allow yourself to feel your reaction again
Taking a moment does not mean that you prevent your reaction altogether
But it gives you time to honor the reaction, and choose how you express it

That's all it takes to start separating your reaction from the trigger stimulating it
A single breath may not seem like much
But it starts moving your reactions from the subconscious to the conscious
Which in turn can lead to stronger relationships and less chronic stress
This practice grows stronger more quickly when you apply it as you experience real annoyances
Just as we did in the exercise, it's easier to start with small triggers and build up to large ones
Thank you for taking a moment with us today.
