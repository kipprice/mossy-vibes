# Self-Care
We are at our best when we are well-cared-for
Today, we'll be focusing on cultivating that care within ourselves
Let's begin by focusing on our breathing

Breathe in... / hold it... / and breathe out
In... / / and out
/
Now, take a moment to see how your body is feeling
Take note of any aches or pain
These are signals your body sends to protect you
Give yourself permission to be kind to those areas
Spend some time visualizing how you can take care of your body today
/
Next, bring your focus to your emotional self
Try to examine what you are currently feeling without judgment
Sometimes emotions can feel like unwelcome visitors in our minds
But just like physical pains, emotions show us what we need in this moment
Take some time to acknowledge and honor your feelings
/
Finally, draw your attention to your internal energy
We can draw energy from a variety of sources: people, pets, nature, hobbies
Self-care can be passive, by avoiding the things that drain you
But self-care can also mean spending your time in a way that fills you up
Consider how you might make time today for something that energizes you
/

It can be hard to set aside time for self-care
Especially if you're more used to caring for others than for yourself
But it's important to take time to replenish your own energy
By caring for yourself, you are better able to extend that care to others
We hope this exercise helped you find care for yourself today!
